# Concrete NDT ML (UPV + ER → Cs, Ts, Fs)

Machine-learning pipelines (RF, GBR, FCNN) that predict concrete **compressive (Cs)**,
**splitting tensile (Ts)**, and **flexural (Fs)** strengths using only
**ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV)** and **electrical resistivity (ER)**.

This repository accompanies the study and code base.
Original end-to-end script: `src/NonDistructive.py` (from the author).
See `docs/USAGE.md` for quickstart.

> Methods & results summarized from the manuscript draft and code: FCNN vs RF/GBR comparison,
> multi-output training, MAE/R² evaluation, figures/workflow. (Manuscript: cited in repo; Code: `src/NonDistructive.py`.)
